# level-up-together

This is primarily targeted at Masters of IT in Business (MITB) Singapore Management University (SMU) students audience whom we have divided into 2 personas.

One big source of inspiration for this is [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) by MIT students.

## Tech Transition Student Personas

- Code-Curious Casey
- AI Aspiring Alex

We choose the names Casey and Alex because they are the most gender neutral while still conforming to alliteration.

The names "Code-Curious Casey" and "AI-Aspiring Alex" are designed to be memorable while highlighting their key characteristics:

- Casey represents the careful but determined career-changer who needs confidence-building and clear pathways
- Alex represents the technically confident professional who needs to bridge specific knowledge gaps

## 1. "Code-Curious Casey"
*The Career Pivoting Professional*

### Background
- Current role in non-tech field (e.g., marketing, finance, or education)

- Currently working on traditional web/mobile applications
- Seeking to pivot into AI/ML/DE space

### Community & Learning Focus
- Actively seeking AI/ML learning communities and study groups
- Wants to contribute to open-source ML projects
- Looking for mentorship opportunities
- Interested in attending AI/ML conferences and meetups
- Desires to build a network in the AI/ML space

### Key Attributes
- Confident with general programming concepts
- Concerned about keeping up with rapid AI advancements
- Wants to stay current with latest frameworks and tools
- Values peer learning and knowledge sharing
- Seeks balance between depth and breadth in AI/ML knowledge

### Typical Questions
- "How do I stay updated with the latest AI research and tools?"
- "Which AI communities are most welcoming to newcomers?"
- "How can I find study partners for ML projects?"
- "What conferences or meetups should I prioritize?"
- "How do I balance learning fundamentals vs. new tools?"
- "What's a good standard ML Lifecycle process to adopt?" See https://ml-ops.org/content/crisp-ml for possible answer

### Dream Roles
- Machine Learning Engineer
- MLOps Engineer
- Data Engineer
- AI Application Developer
- ML Platform Engineer

### Learning Priorities
- Building learning roadmap for emerging AI technologies
- Finding reliable sources for staying updated
- Connecting with AI practitioners and researchers
- Contributing to AI open source projects
- Participating in AI hackathons and competitions


## Learning Paths

### Learning Path for Code-Curious Casey

Taking inspiration from [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

We cover breadth but leave it to your individual selves to go in-depth via Udemy courses and YouTube videos.

- Shell (PowerShell / xMobTerm)
- Command Line (SSH, file operations)
- Version Control (Git)
- GitHub
- Docker and VMs (Cloud)
- IDE (VS Code)
- Database GUI Tools
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- Debugging
- Markdown
- APIs
- Using LLM to learn
- Diagram Drawing (Mermaid)

### Why These Topics For Casey

Mostly for two reasons:

1. They are career show-stoppers
2. They are level-up blockers

**Career Show-stoppers**:
By career show-stoppers, we mean if you want a code-facing tech job and you know **nothing** of this skill, hiring managers will use this to filter you out.

How much to know? Enough basics to get by.

**Level-up Blockers**:
By level-up blockers, we assume you want to be AI-Aspiring Alex eventually, so not knowing this skill may prevent you from going to that level.

How much to know? Again, enough to get by.
