# Rules for learning Git

1. Using Git is a skill. And like most skills, it's 80% mindset-behavioral patterns 20% technical knowledge.
   So rest of the rules cover the 80% aspect.
2. Join a team that's already using Git in a project.
3. Failing 2, start a personal project with Git that's personally meaningful and you work on it near daily.
4. If you lack ideas on how to incorporate Git in your personal project or daily life, ask Lisa and Kimsia for ideas.
5. Prioritize the commands and habits that allow you to reverse any "mistakes" you make. 90% of time, fear stops learners from using Git more often.
6. Create your own lookup table / dictionary for common commands. Create your own markdown guides. You can look at [02-kimsia-git-workflow.md](02-kimsia-git-workflow.md) and [03-kimsia-rebase-from-remote-guide.md](03-kimsia-rebase-from-remote-guide.md) for inspiration.
7. Because we want you to learn Git, future workshops will all use Git (and Markdown) by default.
