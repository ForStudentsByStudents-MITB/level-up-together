# Start Here

1. We are peer learning
2. No instructors, no lectures, no grades.
3. We just provide a venue/environment for MITB students to learn from one another using free online resources.


WE recommend the following resources. You don't have to do all. Just pick one and run with it.

## Udemy
1. SMU offers free Udemy Business subscription
   To access the resource, login using your SMU email and password at: https://smusg.udemy.com/

2. The resource we'll be using this week is Udemy's "Master Git and GitHub in 5 Days: Go from Zero to Hero"
   https://smusg.udemy.com/share/10cdG33@e98xmA8vDJH2z_46Xb7gTEF0JAp1mKvjm5e6e18yBUAnCNFChFgztkPjZ2iAkD0R_w==/

3. For your convenience, resources are shared at:
https://smu.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/FSBSPeerLearningGroup/Shared%20Documents/Session%201%20Git?csf=1&web=1&e=KUkCNC

## GitHub, VS Code
1. SMU students are also eligible for GitHub's education pack, which gives you access to GitHub Pro that includes copilot, etc
   Register at https://education.github.com/pack
   Membership will take awhile to approve, but meanwhile do have an account ready so we can follow along with the course.
   You can add your SMU email to your personal account afterwards to get the free Pro version (that's what I did).

2. Optional but it'd be good to have Git & VS Code installed on your local machines prior to the peer learning session (we only have 2 hours so chop chop). If not, no worries you can get that done on the day itself too.

3. Installation guide can be found at "Day 1 - Introduction to Git", slides 21-29.

4. We'll do the rest during the session itself. See you there!
